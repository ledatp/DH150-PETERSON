# Learning Language
  
## Digital Humanities 150 - Heuristics Evalution by Peterson Le
### Introduction
As a first-generation American, I was privileged to learn a lot about my Vietnamese culture through my parents. However, like others, they wanted me to assimiliate to my environment, consequently making my Vietnamese less than fluent. This made it difficult to communicate outside the scope of basic and general necessities such as "Mẹ ơi, con đang đói" (Mom, I am hungry) or "Mẹ có khỏe không?" (Are you well, mom?). To me, the foundational elements to community and culture is language. Language help deepens your understanding of others for words are masters of expression. Therefore, I have chosen Duolingo and Busuu, two popular language-learning website, as the foci of this heuristic evaluation. <br/>

#### Website 1: [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)
Duolingo is the most popular language-learning wesbite to date. There are currently 32 languages that can be learned through their site, ranging from Spanish to Vietnamese to Swahili. Upon entering the website, you are met with two options: "Get Started" or "I Already Have an Account." The simplicity of this allows both new and past users easy access to their needs. After that, as a new user, you are met with a couple of essential questions asking which language you want to learn and certain goals and reasoning for such. After getting past this stage, users are taken to the site personalized to their language. From first glance, users are met with a gaming-style website (e.g., earn XP, leadership boards) where learning begins. Overall, I appreciate the concision as it helps with transitioning, especially for new users; however, I believe there are minor issues regarding user control, help documentation, and **SOMETHING ELSE. + Insert Pictures**<br/>

#### Website 2: [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/) 
Busuu is another popular language-learning platform that performs similarly to Duolingo, with less language options. Upon entering the site, you are asked to choose a language you would like to learn and answer a couple of essentials question. After that, the user is taken to their language profile with a plethora of categories that they may learn (e.g., Greeting, Pronouns). Overall, I believe this website also has done well in attempts to make it concise and simple to navigate; however, it also shows minor issues regarding **SOMETHING + Insert Pictures**<br/>

### Heuristics Evaluation Ratings
**1**: Site performed below average for this heuristic and could use major reevaluation for better usability.<br/>
**2**: Site performed average for this heuristic and has the potential to be altered for better usability.<br/>

## Duolingo - Nielson's 10 Heuristic Evaluation 
### 1: Visibility of System Status
Duolingo does well in establishing and conveying appropriate information in a timely manner. When learning a lesson, on the top there is a bar that progressively changes colors, indicating that you are making progress each time you get an answer right. This give users an estimate of how many more question they need to answer correctly to progress to the next level.<br/>
<br/>
As previously aforementioned, Duolingo's style is similar to that of a game. Therefore, the user gain EXP for every lesson they complete and compare it to their daily goals that the user stated when creating an account. This is a good indicator for user's to know how much longer they can expect to continue learn on a day-by-day basis based on content rather than time.
<br/>
### 2: Match Between System and Real World
Duolingo has recently introduced "Health" into their system. Users are given 5 hearts per day which are depleted each time you get an answer wrong. Once all hearts are gone, you are unable to progress until you get more (one every five hours or by purchasing lingots). This has resulted in a poor mismatch between the system and the real world. When learning a language, whether you are in a classroom or stranded on foreign land, making mistakes and learning from them are encouraged to enhance learning. This feature has made Duolingo even more of a game for competition rather for a game for personal growth.<br/> 
<br/> 
Duolingo does not offer natural conversations; hence, users are only exposed to short stand-alone phrases (e.g., "con cá cắn cái xe đạp" meaning "the fish bites the bicycle") and single-word definition (e.g., "váy" meaning "skirt"). Although user's are learning simple words and phrases, there is no dialogue which can lead to a misunderstanding of other aspects that are facilitated by landuage. For instance, "Bạn ngủ ngon không?" (Did you sleep well?) is grammatically correct, yet is direspectful depending on the receiver of this conversation due to the inference of age. Because of the lack of dialogue, Duolingo users would not have known this based on the lesson plans provided.
<br/> 
### 3: User Control and Freedom
Upon creating an account, the user establish their goal for the course along with how many minutes per day they plan to study. These goals are able to be altered by the intensity of learning represented by EXP (e.g., daily goal of 50 EXP for intense learning vs. daily goal of 10 EXP for casual learning). This gives users the freedom to control the pace of their learning without pressure, especially due to the fact that Duolingo often send daily notifications to remind its users to study.<br/> 
<br/> 
After completing the placement test upon creating an account, users unlock certain lessons, while others remain locked. To me, it seems like the topics are locked by topic rather than by difficulty. For instance, I am unable to learn numbers until I have learned colors, adjectives, and conjuctions (each of which have their own prerequisite). This leads to poor freedom and control because users are unable to choose and learn topics that are relevant for their current situation without learning all of its latter. This, in combination with Neilson's second heuristic, depicts poor user experience because language is not uniform in this manner (e.g., one does not always learn colors before number, nor would one typically claim that numbers are more difficult than colors). Thus, the ability to advance on lessons should be based on difficulty rather than topic.
<br/> 
### 4: Consistency and Standards
Duolingo does well in staying consistent and meeting the standards of their consumer. An instance of consistency regards the color palette they use to represent how far one is on the lessons (e.g., purple represents lessons that have not been started while gold represents lessons that have been completed). In addition, some topics are repeated in the hierachy of learning. Repeated topics are represented with the same picture, allowing users to know that they are to retrieve information from the first lesson.
<br/> 
### 5: Error Prevention
Although it has its flaws, Duolingo locks certain lesson plans that they have deemed as more difficult based on how you perform during the placement test. In some instances, it is not quite clear why they do it, but some lessons are an extensions of previous ones. By having these locked, it ensures that its user are completely ready to take on the lesson without skipping nonchalantly. This is a form of error prevention as it protects users from overestimating their abilities and prevents guessing and skipping difficult question to complete the lesson for EXP points.
<br/> 
### 6: Recognition Rather than Recall
For each lesson, there are tips that users can access before the lesson. The tips consists of relevant information that pertains to the lesson, but may not have been taught or thoroughly explained prior. Having this option is good for understanding the essentials; however, when starting the lesson you are unable to access it. I believe for learning purposes, users should be allowed to have access to this during the lessons because there Duolingo does not offer another method of understanding *how* these words are used as opposed to *what* the words mean in it's most simple form. To address this, they may leave leaving timed practices (which can be, unfortuneately, purchased for 10 lingots) to be stripped from this feature, making users use recall memory to ensure that they fully understand the words in question.
<br/> 
### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Although some features regarding the gaming aspect of Duolingo hinders the learning experience (e.g., paying for timed practice test), I believe that there is a level of flexibility that comes with it. You can compete with friends and earn spots on the leadership board, which is presumeably how Duolingo received widespread popularity. In contrast, you can distance yourself from that aspect and learn independently, allowing you to work at your own pace. As aforementioned, there are features that makes learning difficult, but the ability to choose your style of learning, your goals, and your pace allows for great flexibility.
<br/> 
### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
I believe aesthetic and minimalist design is something that Duolingo does exceptionally well in. Starting from the account creation to the lesson plans, its design is very simple. The simplicity is great for both new and old users, making the site easy to learn and comprehend as there is no ambiguity as to what the site has to offer. 
<br/>
### 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
When partaking in a lesson, when users get the answer wrong a red pop up appears on screen showcasing the correct answer. After progressing with the lesson, the questions answered incorrectly would be asked again. I believe that this method is good for recognizing that an error has been made and recovering from the error by continually testing for it. It is fast and efficient (i.e, occurring directly after submitting a wrong answer) and continues to follow Duolingo's minimalist approach (e.g., it is simply a red box that states the correct answer with plain texts).
<br/>
### 10: Help and Documentation
After submitting an answer during a lesson, whether it be correct or incorrect, users are able to access the discussion board for that specific question if they have any questions for it. On one hand, this element is beneficial because Duolingo cannot predict every question beforehand, so having this option allows even the most unique questions to be answered. In addition, by having users answer each other's questions, it provides those who help others with the chance to relearn through teaching; thus, promoting a symbiotic relationship between those who answer and those who ask. On the other hand, if the question has not been asked previously, you will not receive an answer right away, which may prove to be unhelpful if you choose to move on with your lesson. Moreover, I am unsure if Duolingo filters out incorrect explanations to the question because information provided by other users may also be incorrect.
