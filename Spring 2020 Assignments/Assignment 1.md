# Learning Language
  
## Digital Humanities 150 - Heuristics Evalution by Peterson Le
### Motivation
As a first-generation American, I was privileged to learn a lot about my Vietnamese culture through my parents. However, like others, they wanted me to assimiliate to my environment, consequently making my Vietnamese less than fluent. This made it difficult to communicate outside the scope of basic and general necessities such as "Mẹ ơi, con đang đói" (Mom, I am hungry) or "Mẹ có khỏe không?" (Are you well, mom?). To me, the foundational elements to community and culture is language. Language help deepens your understanding of others for words are masters of expression. Therefore, I have chosen Duolingo and Busuu, two popular language-learning website, as the foci of this heuristic evaluation. <br/>

#### Website 1: [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)
Duolingo is the most popular language-learning wesbite to date. There are currently 32 languages that can be learned through their site, ranging from Spanish to Vietnamese to Swahili. Upon entering the website, you are met with two options: "Get Started" or "I Already Have an Account." The simplicity of this allows both new and past users easy access to their needs. After that, as a new user, you are met with a couple of essential questions asking which language you want to learn and certain goals and reasoning for such. After getting past this stage, users are taken to the site personalized to their language. From first glance, users are met with a gaming-style website (e.g., earn XP, leadership boards) where learning begins. Overall, I appreciate the concision and simplicity as it helps with transitioning, especially for new users; however, I believe there are minor issues regarding user control, help documentation, and visibility of system status. <br/>

#### Website 2: [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/) 
Busuu is another popular language-learning platform that performs similarly to Duolingo, with less language options. Upon entering the site, you are asked to choose a language you would like to learn and answer a couple of essentials question. After that, the user is taken to their language profile with a plethora of categories that they may learn (e.g., Greeting, Pronouns). Overall, I believe this website also has done well in attempts to make it concise and simple to navigate; however, it also shows minor issues regarding user freedom and control, consistency and standards, and error prevention. <br/>

### Heuristics Evaluation Severity Ratings
**1**: Site performed average for this heuristic and does not need to be reevaluated/altered for better usability.<br/>
**2**: Site performed slightly below average for this heuristic and has the potential to be altered for better usability.<br/>
**3**: Site performed below average for this heuristic and could use major immediate reevaluation for better usability.<br/>

## Duolingo - Nielson's 10 Heuristic Evaluation 
### 1: Visibility of System Status
***Severity Rating: 2***
Duolingo does not give new users any information about things such as leadership boards, lingots, and health when they start learning. Therefore, as I went through the lessons and lost health, I was unaware of what that meant. Losing health means that I am unable to progress further with learning unless I purchase more health through lingots or wait hours to regain them. I believe Duolingo could have done more to help users integrate themselves into the site without having to find out through trial and error. Because their style of having a game-like design is unique, I believe having tutorials for these features should be added.<br/>
<br/>
***Severity Rating: 2***
When learning a lesson, there is a bar on top that progressively fills up with different color, indicating that you are making progress each time you get an answer right. This give users a *rough* estimate of how many more question they need to answer correctly to progress to the next level. I understand that it is difficult to give exact time because individuals will learn at their own pace; however, I believe a feature could be added to tell users exactly how many questions in total they need correct to move on from a given lesson.

### 2: Match Between System and Real World
***Severity Rating: 1***
Duolingo uses relevant pictures to depict what would be learned. For instance, if you are learning clothing, a picture of asock would represent the lesson. In addition, Duolingo's drop boxes are also represented in the same fashion (i.e., picture/designs paired with words that represent one another). I believe this a good example of this heuristic as it makes it more simple and efficient for users to navigate the site.<br/>
<br/>

***Severity Rating: 2***
Duolingo has a section for "Next Achievement" with a goal given to its user. When clicking on it, I realized that I had not completed the achievements prior to the one that I am currently on. I believe the word "Next" was misleading as it was used to mean which achievement I was closest to achieving rather than meaning an sequential order of achievement that I was to complete. By wording it in this manner, I did not attempt other achievements because I assumed there was an order to them similarly to how there is an order to the lessons.
<br/>

![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63027004/78642844-35a29200-7868-11ea-9395-e6bb1a7dc6a2.png)
### 3: User Control and Freedom
***Severity Rating: 2***
Upon creating an account, the user establish their goal for the course along with how many minutes per day they plan to study. These goals are able to be altered by the intensity of learning represented by EXP (e.g., daily goal of 50 EXP for intense learning vs. daily goal of 10 EXP for casual learning). This gives users the freedom to control the pace of their learning without pressure. A critique for this, however, would be in how to  change your goal and intensity. In the drop box menu after clicking on your profile icon, it is located in the "Coach" option; the wording for this is not a clear representation of what it offers, making it difficult to find.<br/> 
<br/> 
![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63027004/78643127-9cc04680-7868-11ea-9e8b-4581ed703db3.png)
***Severity Rating: 2***
After completing the placement test upon creating an account, users unlock certain lessons, while others remain locked. To me, it seems like the topics are locked by topic rather than by difficulty. This leads to poor freedom and control because users are unable to choose and learn topics that are relevant for their current situation without learning all of its latter. For instance, if I am looking to learn numbers in Vietnamese, I would have to complete 20 lessons that are not particularly relevant to learning Vietnamese numbers.
<br/> 
### 4: Consistency and Standards
***Severity Rating: 1***
Duolingo does well in staying consistent and meeting the standards of their consumer. An instance of consistency regards the color palette they use to represent how far one is on the lessons (e.g., purple represents lessons that have not been started while gold represents lessons that have been completed). In addition, some topics are repeated in the hierachy of learning. Repeated topics are represented with the same picture, allowing users to know that they are to retrieve information from the first lesson.
<br/> 
### 5: Error Prevention
***Severity Rating: 1***
Although it has its flaws, Duolingo locks certain lesson plans (which is indicated clearly by a grey image) that they have deemed as more difficult based on how you perform during the placement test. In some instances (see Nielson's Heuristic 3), it is can come at the expense of user's freedom and control, but some lessons are an extensions of previous ones. By having these locked, it ensures that its user are completely ready to take on the lesson. This is a form of error prevention as it protects users from overestimating their abilities and prevents guessing and skipping difficult question to complete the lesson for EXP points. In addition, I believe the general minimalist design, which can be seen in Nielson's Heuristic 8, of the site also act towards preventing errors. With a site with limited features to be pressed, it is very difficult to make mistakes. From creating accounts to advancing in lessons, everything is laid out in plain text that help users understand the site's possibilities.<br/>
<br/> 
***Severity Rating: 1***
Another use of error prevention from Duolingo occurs when users "X" out of a lesson. When this occurs, a pop up shows up asking whether the user is sure that they want to perform this task because doing so would result in the loss of progress. This is great because when I started using the site, I thought that progress would be saved even if I had just answered a few question. Thus, having this feature prevented me from making this mistake.
![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63027004/78643401-11938080-7869-11ea-9ac7-163717b848dc.png)
### 6: Recognition Rather than Recall
***Severity Rating: 2***
For each lesson, there are tips that users can access before learning. The tips consists of relevant information that pertains to the lesson, but may not have been taught or thoroughly explained prior. Having this option is good for understanding the essentials; however, when starting the lesson you are unable to access it. Therefore, you must recall blocks of information that will pertain to all of the questions, making it difficult to fully grasp the concepts. Other sites have features that integrates the tips into the lesson plan that allowing you to see it, study it, and recognize it in future questions.
<br/> 
### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
***Severity Rating: 1***
An interesting feature of Duolingo that allows for more flexibility and efficiency of use are the keyboard shortcuts that can be used during the lessons. Examples of such includes: 1, 2, 3 to click on answers; "Enter" key to submit; "Ctrl" + "Space" to replay audio; and the list goes on. Having this option allow users to choose methods in which make their experience more efficient. In addition, some questions have multiple way of answering them. For example, you either type the answer using your keyboard or use the word blanks provided.<br/>
<br/>
***Severity Rating: 2***
One flaw about the flexibility above is that you are unable to find the keyboard shortcut through Duolingo. I have used the "Help" option and clicked around endlessly to find it; however, this information is not made available to the users. Therefore, I used outside sources (e.g., Reddit) to discover Duolingo's keyboard shortcut.
![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63027004/78643624-5fa88400-7869-11ea-896e-9d4ed5ad295b.png)
### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
***Severity Rating: 1***
I believe aesthetic and minimalist design is something that Duolingo does exceptionally well in. Starting from the account creation to the lesson plans, its design is very simple. The simplicity is great for both new and old users, making the site easy to learn and comprehend as there is no ambiguity as to what the site has to offer. 
<br/>
### 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
***Severity Rating: 1***
When partaking in a lesson, when users get the answer wrong a red pop up appears on screen showcasing the correct answer. After progressing with the lesson, the questions answered incorrectly would be asked again. I believe that this method is good for recognizing that an error has been made and recovering from the error by continually testing for it. It is fast and efficient (i.e, occurring directly after submitting a wrong answer) and continues to follow Duolingo's minimalist approach (e.g., it is simply a red box that states the correct answer with plain texts).
<br/>
![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63027004/78643815-b746ef80-7869-11ea-82af-fbef6ac11518.png)
### 10: Help and Documentation
***Severity Rating: 3***
After submitting an answer during a lesson, whether it be correct or incorrect, users are able to access the discussion board for that specific question if they have any questions for it. On one hand, this element is beneficial because Duolingo cannot predict every question beforehand, so having this option allows even the most unique questions to be answered. On the other hand, if the question has not been asked previously, you will not receive an answer right away, which may prove to be unhelpful if you choose to move on with your lesson. As shown in the picture below, this question was asked two years ago and was answered a year after. Receiving help should be faster and more efficient than this.<br/>
<br/>
![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63027004/78643918-e2c9da00-7869-11ea-9151-595aee63a6ce.png)
***Severity Rating: 1***
Another form of Help and Documentation is one used for the general website, independent from the lesson that the users are learning. This would be questions that pertains to lingots, leadership boards, health, and many other Duolingo features. As I have tested it out, it seems to answer a lot of questions that new users may be unaware of. Although a quick and simple tutorial would answer a lot of these questions, I believe the Help page is useful, concise, and thorough.
<br/>
## Busuu - Nielson's 10 Heuristic Evaluation
### 1: Visibility of System Status
***Severity Rating: 1***
Before starting a lesson on Busuu, the site informs its user how long (represented by minutes) would a course take. This allows its users to know how long they should expect to study for each category as well as see how many lessons should they complete to meet the goals that they have stated during the sign-up process. This is a great feature because each lesson plan are not evenly distributed in content, so knowing beforehand would allow users to properly manage their time. In addition to that, there is a progress bar on top of the lesson to further indicate time.
<br/>
### 2: Match Between System and Real Life
***Severity Rating: 1***
In an attempt to make the learning feel more similar to real life, each lesson is represented by icons of real people, places, and objects that have to do with the topic. Moreover, within each lesson, most of the questions are associated with a picture that help users understand the context in which the words or phrases would be used in. Lastly, the pages throughout the entire website uses relevant icons that represent the page (e.g., Busuu's "Social" page is represented with chat bubbles). These features in combination with each other helps create a match between the system and real life.
<br/>
### 3: User Control and Freedom
***Severity Rating: 2***
Busuu offer users complete control over their learning. Unlike Duolingo, where certain lessons are locked, all of Busuu's lessons are completely unlock. Therefore, the users are able to contruct their learning on what interested them, along with what is relevant for them. As a speaker of my native tongue, I find this very useful because there are specific topics that I am not fluent in; so, this type of learning would be great for me. However, this also comes at a cost. With all lessons opened the website can be very overwhelming, especially due to the fact that there could be up to 125 different lessons each coupled with their own subsets of material on a single page. I believe there should be happy medium between what Duolingo and Busuu offers, allowing users a great amount of freedom without feeling like there is a lack of structure.<br/>
<br/>
### 4: Consistency and Standards
***Severity Rating: 2***
For the most part Busuu meets the standards of consistency; however, there are some flaws. Busuu gives you the option to make and discover friends; however, there are two icons that represents the same thing which can be confusing. As shown, one is an icon of a chat bubble, while the other is an icon of two individuals. When clicking on the chat bubble "Social" page, it showcases the other icon surrounding a picture of Earth. I believe both buttons can be represented by the same icon as they pertain to very similar features within the site for more consistency.<br/>
<br/>
***Severity Rating: 2***
Another aspect that I found inconsistent is that some lessons have a "Vocabulary" sub-lesson, while others have a "Discover" sub-lesson. No lessons have both vocabulary and discover. Although the description of both are different at face value, when clicking on each one they test similar items in a similar format. Therefore, I believe it would suffice to use "Discover" to represent both. 
### 5: Error Prevention
***Severity Rating: 2***
As previously stated, Busuu allow its user complete autonomy when it comes to their learning. This means that users do not have to take a placement test, have access to up to 125 different lessons, and can move freely from the beginner, intermediate, and advance settings. I believe too much freedom and control can be a negative in which users are overwhelmed by the options they have. Therefore, this is considerably poor representation of error prevention. To me, it felt like there was less structure, so I had difficulty navigating the site to find what lesson best fit my interests.<br/>
<br/>
***Severity Rating: 1***
One successful use of error prevention from Busuu occurs when users "X" out of a lesson. When this occurs, a pop up shows up asking whether the user is sure that they want to perform this task because doing so would result in the loss of progress. This is great because when I started using the site, I thought that progress would be saved even if I had just answered a few question. Thus, having this feature prevented me from making this mistake.
<br/>
### 6 : Recognition Rather than Recall
***Severity Rating: 1***
One issue that I addressed in Duolingo is that they required users to recall "Tips" that were not previously taught and was going to be used in the lesson. Busuu, on the other hand, integrates the tips into the lesson. This allow users to study for the material right before they are introduced to it. Hence, they can recognize when and how certain words and phrases are used instead of recalling it from before the lesson began.
<br/>
### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
***Severity Rating: 1***
Busuu offers keyboard shortcuts that makes aspects of learning more efficient beyond the mousepad. For instance, they provide users with the ability to use the up arrow to replay audio, left arrow to go to the previous image, enter to save words, and the list goes on. I believe this is good use of flexibility as it allow users to choose different methods that would make their learning more efficient.
<br/>
### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
***Severity Rating: 1***
Aside from the overwhelming amount of lessons on one page that was previously discussed, I tend to gravitate more towards Busuu's design over Duolingo's. I think without the gaming aspect, the site is very calm to look at, especially because it is also very simplistic. The simplicity in this site also is great for both new and old users as it takes away much ambiguity as to what the site has to offer.
<br/>
### 9: Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
***Severity Rating: 1***
When getting an answer incorrect during the lesson, a small text pops up at the bottom screen with the words "Incorrect" following a "X." The simplicity of this conveys the message very clearly. It then proceeds to tell the user the correct answer and repeats the question later in the lesson to ensure that they have receovered from their errors.
<br/>
### 10: Help and Documentation
***Severity Rating: 1***
Busuu's help is very easy to use and accessible. There is a specific button to receive a tour of the entire site, allowing users to know everything that the site has to offer. In addition, there is a separate help page that is quick and simple to use. The help page also auto-finishes questions with a drop bar menu, this makes things more efficient and help users figure out how to frame their questions for quick access.
