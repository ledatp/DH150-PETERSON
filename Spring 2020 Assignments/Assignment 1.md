# Learning Language
  
## Digital Humanities 150 - Heuristics Evalution by Peterson Le
As a first-generation American, I was privileged to learn a lot about my Vietnamese culture through my parents. However, like others, they wanted me to assimiliate to my environment, consequently making my Vietnamese less than fluent. This made it difficult to communicate outside the scope of basic and general necessities such as "Mẹ ơi, con đang đói" (Mom, I am hungry) or "Mẹ có khỏe không?" (Are you well, mom?). To me, the foundational elements to community and culture is language. Language help deepens your understanding of others for words are masters of expression. Therefore, I have chosen Duolingo and Busuu, two popular language-learning website, as the foci of this heuristic evaluation. <br/>

#### Website 1: [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)
Duolingo is the most popular language-learning wesbite to date. There are currently 32 languages that can be learned through their site, ranging from Spanish to Vietnamese to Swahili. Upon entering the website, you are met with two options: "Get Started" or "I Already Have an Account." The simplicity of this allows both new and past users easy access to their needs. After that, as a new user, you are met with a couple of essential questions asking which language you want to learn and certain goals and reasoning for such. After getting past this stage, users are taken to the site personalized to their language. From first glance, users are met with a gaming-style website (e.g., earn XP, leadership boards) where learning begins. Overall, I appreciate the concision as it helps with transitioning, especially for new users; however, I believe there are minor issues regarding user control, help documentation, and **SOMETHING ELSE. + Insert Pictures**<br/>

#### Website 2: [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/) 
Busuu is another popular language-learning platform that performs similarly to Duolingo, with less language options. Upon entering the site, you are asked to choose a language you would like to learn and answer a couple of essentials question. After that, the user is taken to their language profile with a plethora of categories that they may learn (e.g., Greeting, Pronouns). Overall, I believe this website also has done well in attempts to make it concise and simple to navigate; however, it also shows minor issues regarding **SOMETHING + Insert Pictures**<br/>

### Heuristics Evaluation Ratings
**1**: Site performed below average for this heuristic and could use major reevaluation for better usability.<br/>
**2**: Site performed average for this heuristic and has the potential to be altered for better usability.<br/>
**3**: Site performed above average for this heuristic and does not need to be reevaluated/altered for better usability.<br/>

## Duolingo - Nielson's 10 Heuristic Evaluation 
### 1: Visibility of System Status
Duolingo does well in establishing and conveying appropriate information in a timely manner. When learning a lesson, on the top there is a bar that progressively changes colors, indicating that you are making progress each time you get an answer right. This give users an estimate of how many more question they need to answer correctly to progress to the next level.<br/>
<br/>
As previously aforementioned, Duolingo's style is similar to that of a game. Therefore, the user gain EXP for every lesson they complete and compare it to their daily goals that the user stated when creating an account. This is a good indicator for user's to know how much longer they can expect to continue learn on a day-by-day basis based on content rather than time.
<br/>
### 2: Match Between System and Real World
Duolingo has recently introduced "Health" into their system. Users are given 5 hearts per day which are depleted each time you get an answer wrong. Once all hearts are gone, you are unable to progress until you get more (one every five hours or by purchasing lingots). This has resulted in a poor mismatch between the system and the real world. When learning a language, whether you are in a classroom or stranded on foreign land, making mistakes and learning from them are encouraged to enhance learning. This feature has made Duolingo even more of a game for competition rather for a game for personal growth.<br/> 
<br/> 
Duolingo does not offer natural conversations; hence, users are only exposed to short stand-alone phrases and single-word definition. Although user's are learning simple words and phrases, there is no dialogue which can lead to a misunderstanding of other aspects that are facilitated by landuage. For instance, "Bạn ngủ ngon không?" (Did you sleep well?) is correct, yet is direspectful depending on the receiver of this conversation due to the inference of age. Because of the lack of dialogue, Duolingo users would not have known this based on the lesson plans provided.<br/> 
<br/> 
### 3: User Control and Freedom
Upon creating an account, the user establish their goal for the course along with how many minutes per day they plan to study. These goals are able to be altered by the intensity of learning represented by EXP (e.g., daily goal of 50 EXP for intense learning vs. daily goal of 10 EXP for casual learning). This gives users the freedom to control the pace of their learning without pressure, especially due to the fact that Duolingo often send daily notifications to remind its users to study.<br/> 
<br/> 
After completing the placement test upon creating an account, users unlock certain lessons, while others remain locked. To me, it seems like the topics are locked by topic rather than by difficulty. For instance, I am unable to learn numbers until I have learned colors, adjectives, and conjuctions (each of which have their own prerequisite). This leads to poor freedom and control because users are unable to choose and learn topics that are relevant for their current situation without learning all of its latter. This, in combination with Neilson's second heuristic, depicts poor user experience because language is not uniform in this manner (e.g., one does not always learn colors before number, nor would one typically claim that numbers are more difficult than colors). Thus, the ability to advance on lessons should be based on difficulty rather than topic.
<br/> 
### 4: Consistency and Standards
Duolingo does well in staying consistent and meeting the standards of their consumer. An instance of consistency regards the color palette they use to represent how far one is on the lessons (e.g., purple represents lessons that have not been started while gold represents lessons that have been completed). In addition, some topics are repeated in the hierachy of learning. Repeated topics are represented with the same picture, allowing users to know that they are to retrieve information from the first lesson.

### 5: Error Prevention
