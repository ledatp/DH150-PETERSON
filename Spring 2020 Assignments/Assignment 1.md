# Learning Language
  
## Digital Humanities 150 - Heuristics Evalution by Peterson Le
As a first-generation American, I was privileged to learn a lot about my Vietnamese culture through my parents. However, like others, they wanted me to assimiliate to my environment, consequently making my Vietnamese less than fluent. This made it difficult to communicate outside the scope of basic and general necessities such as "Mẹ ơi, con đang đói" (Mom, I am hungry) or "Mẹ có khỏe không?" (Are you well, mom?). To me, the foundational elements to community and culture is language. Language help deepens your understanding of others for words are masters of expression. Therefore, I have chosen Duolingo and Busuu, two popular language-learning website, as the foci of this heuristic evaluation. <br/>

#### Website 1: [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/)
Duolingo is the most popular language-learning wesbite to date. There are currently 32 languages that can be learned through their site, ranging from Spanish to Vietnamese to Swahili. Upon entering the website, you are met with two options: "Get Started" or "I Already Have an Account." The simplicity of this allows both new and past users easy access to their needs. After that, as a new user, you are met with a couple of essential questions asking which language you want to learn and certain goals and reasoning for such. After getting past this stage, users are taken to the site personalized to their language. From first glance, users are met with a gaming-style website (e.g., earn XP, leadership boards) where learning begins. Overall, I appreciate the concision as it helps with transitioning, especially for new users; however, I believe there are minor issues regarding user control, help documentation, and **SOMETHING ELSE. + Insert Pictures**<br/>

#### Website 2: [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/) 
Busuu is another popular language-learning platform that performs similarly to Duolingo, with less language options. Upon entering the site, you are asked to choose a language you would like to learn and answer a couple of essentials question. After that, the user is taken to their language profile with a plethora of categories that they may learn (e.g., Greeting, Pronouns). Overall, I believe this website also has done well in attempts to make it concise and simple to navigate; however, it also shows minor issues regarding **SOMETHING + Insert Pictures**<br/>
